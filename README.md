# TASK-3-Linear-Regression


House Price Prediction Project
-------------------------------
This project applies linear regression to predict house prices using multiple numerical features from the Housing dataset.


Tasks Performed
----------------
- Imported and cleaned the dataset
- Encoded the categorical feature (furnishingstatus)
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained a multiple linear regression model using scikit-learn
- Evaluated model performance using MAE, MSE, and RÂ²
- Visualized actual vs predicted prices
- Interpreted model coefficients


Libraries Used
--------------
-pandas
-numpy
-matplotlib
-seaborn
-sklearn


Final Output
-------------
A trained and evaluated regression model with insights into feature influence on house prices. Predictions and performance metrics included for test data.
